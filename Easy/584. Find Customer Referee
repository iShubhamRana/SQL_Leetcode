MySQL uses three-valued logic -- TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. 
Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. 
That “anything” includes NULL itself! That’s why MySQL provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to specifically check for NULL.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    name 
FROM 
    Customer 
WHERE 
   (referee_id is NULL or  referee_id!=2)
