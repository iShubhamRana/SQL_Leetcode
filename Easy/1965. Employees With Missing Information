QUESTION: https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-with-missing-information/


APPROACH 1: USING FULL JOIN
1. ON FULL JOIN MISSING VALUES IN BOTH TABLES ARE FILLED WITH NULL
2. FULL JOIN IS NOT DIRECTLY AVAILABLE IN MYSQL THEREFORE WE NEED TO USE LEFT AND RIGHT JOIN WITH UNION

SELECT T.employee_Id
FROM
( SELECT * FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id)
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM Employees RIGHT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id) 
) AS T
WHERE T.salary IS NULL OR T.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id





APPROACH 2: USING 2 QUERIES AND THEN UNION , 
JUST FIND EMPLOYEES_ID WITH NO SALARIES IN TABLE 2 AND VICE VERSA

SELECT T.employee_Id
FROM
( SELECT * FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id)
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM Employees RIGHT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id) 
) AS T
WHERE T.salary IS NULL OR T.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id
