Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-who-visited-but-did-not-make-any-transactions/


APPROACH 1: using subquery
1. Use subquery to get all visit_ids from transactions table
2. use groupby and check if the visit_id is not in the subquery result
3. Then use aggregate function

select customer_id , count(*) as count_no_trans
from Visits
where visit_id
not in
(    
select distinct visit_id 
from Transactions
)
group by customer_id


APPROACH 2: using leftjoin 
1. Perform a left join on visit_id and then visits with no transactions will have transaction_id as null
2. we can group by customer_id and count visit_ids with transaction id as null

select customer_id , count(*) as count_no_trans 
from 
    Visits v left join Transactions t
on v.visit_id=t.visit_id
where 
    t.transaction_id is null
group by customer_id
