QUESTION:https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/

TOPIC: OFFSET : it tells from which row to select

APPROACH 1: 
1. Selecting from an empty table always gives a null in field
2. use a second select statement for handling the case when there is only one record

SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;




APPROACH 2: USING IFNULL

 IFNULL(expression, alt_value) : we just provide an alternative value for the expression
 
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
.
